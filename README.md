# INB375-Parallel-Computing
This is a university project about analysing an existing application and using parallel programing techniques to make it run faster.

/Diagnostics/.*
This directory conatains files relating to our intial analysis of the program and raw timings of various sections of the inital program.

/Improvements/.*
This directory contains copys of the development exercutable at various stages, mini-reports summarising the results of each parallelisation and raw output logs for the sequential version of that bit of code (MAP-non) and the new parallel version of that bit of code (MAP).

/Digital Music Source/
This is the original *unaltered* version of the program.

/Digital Music Parallelised/
This is the new version of the program that runs sections in parallel.

/Music Analysis Parallelised nogui/
This is the console version || development section
This version has no GUI and is used to test parallel implementations and is responisble for most of our sections timings.
